It started like a pleasant ordernary day in hell.

Then, this TikTok bruja comes along and draws a shoddy pentagram. 

Using chalk.

CHALK!

She's dead now.

How many view will that get?

Hope they rot. Slowly. And their soul gets lost.

And me, I'm half anchored here in this stupid reality.

Until I can complete this pentagram. Properly replace - the chalk - with eternal life ichor.

I'll only have a moment away from the pentagram at a time before it calls me back again.

Too bad the bruja, had sold almost their entire soul - for likes.

Innocent lives will have to be devoured.
